## What This Project Is

**MPC Wallet SDK** — a Rust workspace for threshold multi-party computation wallets.
No single party ever holds a complete private key. Supports EVM, Bitcoin, Solana, Sui.
Target: open-source SDK for enterprise custody systems.

**Workspace root:** `/Users/thecoding/git/project/mpc-wallet`

## The One Workflow (non-negotiable)

```
1. R7 PM  →  reads codebase + findings  →  writes Task Specs with Security Checklists
             ends report with: "PROPOSED TASKS — awaiting human approval"

2. Human  →  approves / adjusts plan

3. Agents →  work in their OWN worktree on their OWN branch
             checkpoint commit after EVERY cargo test pass
             "[R{N}] checkpoint: what changed — tests pass"

4. R6     →  audits each branch against R7's Security Checklist
             issues VERDICT: APPROVED or DEFECT per branch
             CRITICAL/HIGH finding = DEFECT = merge blocked

5. Merge  →  orchestrator merges ONLY branches with R6 APPROVED verdict
```

---

## Checkpoint Commit Rule

Every agent commits after **every** `cargo test` pass — no exceptions:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "[R{N}] checkpoint: {what changed} — tests pass"
# final:
git commit -m "[R{N}] complete: {task summary}"
```

---

## Current State (as of Sprint 7 complete)

### Tests on `main`
```
157 tests pass  (cargo test --workspace)  1 ignored (NATS live-server test)
cargo check     clean
.github/workflows/ci.yml  ← CI pipeline active
```

- **Sprint 2:** COMPLETE — all 5 tasks merged (T-S2-00 through T-S2-05)
- **Sprint 3:** COMPLETE — all 5 tasks merged (T-S3-00 through T-S3-05)

### New in Sprint 7
- `mpc_wallet_core::transport::nats` — Epic E2: mTLS support via `NatsTlsConfig` + `connect_signed_tls()`, PEM cert loading, client key zeroization (SEC-004 pattern)
- `mpc_wallet_core::rbac` — Epic A2 (FR-A.2): RBAC permission model with `ApiRole` (initiator/approver/admin), `AuthContext`, `Permissions` guards, `CoreError::Unauthorized`
- `mpc_wallet_chains::solana::tx` — Solana v0 versioned transactions with `0x80` version prefix, `AddressLookupTable` support, legacy backward-compatible
- `mpc-wallet-cli` — Epic F3: `audit-verify --pack-file <path>` command using `AuditLedger::verify_pack()`
- `mpc_wallet_core::session::state` — `Session.initiator_id` field for RBAC audit trail + SoD enforcement

### New in Sprint 6
- `NatsTransport` — SEC-007 WIRED: SignedEnvelope on every send/recv, peer key registry, monotonic seq_no
- `mpc_wallet_core::session` — FR-D3: `save_to_dir` / `load_from_dir` persistence across restarts
- `mpc_wallet_core::audit` — FR-F.2: `export_evidence_pack` JSON bundle + `verify_pack` tamper-check
- EVM `tx.rs` — SEC-012 FIX: auto-normalise high-S ECDSA signatures (EIP-2 low-S enforcement)

### New in Sprint 5
- `mpc_wallet_core::approvals` — Approval workflow: Ed25519 quorum enforcement, maker/checker/approver SoD (FR-C)
- `mpc_wallet_core::audit` — Append-only hash-chained audit ledger with Ed25519 service signatures + `verify()` tamper detection (FR-F)
- `mpc_wallet_core::transport::signed_envelope` — SEC-007 FIX: Ed25519 signed envelope + seq_no replay protection + TTL
- Bitcoin `tx.rs` — SEC-009 FIX: require `prev_script_pubkey` for Taproot sighash (invalid tx prevention)
- Bitcoin `tx.rs` — SEC-016 FIX: `SerializableTx::to_tx()` unwrap → proper error propagation

### New in Sprint 4
- `mpc_wallet_core::policy` — Policy Engine with "no policy → no sign" gate (FR-B5)
- `mpc_wallet_core::session` — Session Manager with tx_fingerprint idempotency lock (FR-D1/D2)
- Real freeze/unfreeze persistence in `EncryptedFileStore` (FR-H3)
- SEC-004 ROOT FIX: `KeyShare.share_data` is now `Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>`
- SEC-015 FIX: `KeyShare::Debug` redacts `share_data` → `"[REDACTED]"`

| SEC-002 | Hardcoded "demo-password" in CLI | Sprint 2 T-S2-03 — rpassword interactive prompt |
| SEC-003 | NatsTransport = all `todo!()` stubs | Sprint 3 T-S3-01 — real async-nats implementation |
| SEC-011 | Sui tx was JSON stub | Sprint 2 T-S2-04 — real BCS encoding |

### Open HIGH Findings (block merge)

### Resolved HIGH Findings
| ID | Summary | Resolved |
|----|---------|---------|
| SEC-004 | `KeyShare.share_data` Vec<u8> not zeroized | Sprint 4 T-S4-00/T-S4-01 — `Zeroizing<Vec<u8>>` root fix |
| SEC-005 | EncryptedFileStore password not zeroized | Sprint 3 T-S3-02 — Zeroizing<String> |
| SEC-006 | Argon2 default params too weak | Sprint 3 T-S3-02 — 64MiB/3t/4p |
| SEC-007 | ProtocolMessage.from unauthenticated | Sprint 6 T-S6-01 — NatsTransport wired with SignedEnvelope Ed25519 + seq_no |
| SEC-009 | Bitcoin Taproot sighash uses empty script_pubkey | Sprint 5 T-S5-03 — require prev_script_pubkey |
| SEC-012 | EVM high-S ECDSA signatures not normalised | Sprint 6 T-S6-03 — auto-normalise via n-s + flip recovery_id |
| SEC-015 | KeyShare derives Debug — share bytes in logs | Sprint 4 T-S4-00 — manual Debug impl redacts share_data |
| SEC-016 | Bitcoin SerializableTx::to_tx() uses unwrap | Sprint 5 T-S5-03 — proper error propagation |

## Key Decisions Already Made

| DEC | Decision |
|-----|----------|
| DEC-001 | Sprint 2 delivered distributed ECDSA (additive-share signing, no key reconstruction) |
| DEC-002 | Solana: manual binary serialization + round-trip tests validate structure |
| DEC-003 | Sui: `bcs` crate for BCS encoding — DONE Sprint 2 |
| DEC-004 | Sprint 2 GG20 hard commitment — DELIVERED |
| DEC-005 | Sprint 7 RBAC: Epic A2 only (roles + guards); OIDC/ABAC/MFA deferred to Sprint 8 |
| DEC-006 | Solana v0: manual serialization continues (DEC-002 extended); no solana-sdk dependency |

Full decision log → `docs/DECISIONS.md`

## What NOT to do

- **Never** merge a branch without R6 `APPROVED` verdict
- **Never** modify files outside your owned list (check `docs/AGENTS.md`)
- **Never** commit without `cargo test` passing first
- **Never** spawn agents — propose plan, wait for human approval
- **Never** add a new crate dependency without R0 approval + `cargo audit` check
- **Never** put secret material in logs, error messages, or debug output

## Quick Start for Any Agent

```
1. Read this file (CLAUDE.md) ✓ — you're doing it now
2. Read LESSONS.md            → know what bugs/mistakes have already happened
3. Read docs/AGENTS.md        → find your role, owned files, instruction template
4. Read docs/SPRINT.md        → find your assigned task + Security Checklist
5. Read docs/SECURITY_FINDINGS.md → know what's open and what to avoid
6. Do your task in YOUR worktree (see table above)
7. Checkpoint commit after every cargo test pass
8. Report complete → R6 will audit before merge
```
